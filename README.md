##### case for shieldXL + PiSugar S plus

This is a case I designed for my shieldXL to add an internal battery. I had a couple of requirements: use the original shieldXL faceplate, add lots of extra cooling for the warm-running Raspberry Pi 4, and integrate the PiSugar S plus battery with as little increase in size as possible.

This project is **heavily** influenced by <a href=https://github.com/JGuzak/shieldXl_battery>jordo's ShieldXL battery case</a>, definitely check it out.
